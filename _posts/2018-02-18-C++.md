* gdb: `set print asm-demangle`.  
* objdump: `--demangle|-C` option.  
* c++filt: as a tool into which source piped.  
  
  
>**Dose member function a function pointer?**
   
  

Not exactly.  
Member functions are normal functions with repectively `this` pointer as first parameter. They located at `.text` and occupy no space in object instance.  

>**Initializer list**

Initializer list construct members follow the order exactly the members are declared.  

```cpp
class X {
public:
 X() : a(10), b(a) {}
private:
 int b;
 int a;
};
```

`b` could be initialized to anything.

>**this & inheritance & Virtual Tables**  

```bash
+===============+
|      ebp      |<- ebp
+---------------+
|      ebx      |<- esp + 32
+---------------+
|               |
+---------------+
|               |<- esp + 16(foo)
+---------------+
|               |<- esp + 20(bar)
+---------------+
|               |<- esp + 24(baz)
+---------------+
\               \
/               /
+---------------+
|               |<- esp
+---------------+
```

**_NOTES:_**  
* `this`(point to object instance) as first parameter, will be push on stack before calling `member function`.  

* When a object is being allocated, constructor of most close parent class will be called, layer by layer, so on and so on.  

* First 4/8 bytes of an object is `VTable pointer`, the virtual table is located at `.rodata` section.  

* Virtual functions or functions `overlap` with inherited virtual function are placed in VTable.  

* When construction happens, `vtable + 8`(32 bits arch) is placed at the beginning of the object as `VTable pointer`.

>**Polymorphism**

C++ do `dynamic dispatch` via virtual function table to implement runtime polymorphism.  

Virtual table is initialized on memory allocation to request class. If there's a pointer cast, ordinary member function will be called as `static dispatch` (hardcoded by compiler) depending on new casted typed, but virtual functions use the virtual table initialized before.
