> **socket type**

1. **_Datagram socket_**, also known as connectionless socket. Datagram socket uses `UDP` and should be bound to the `wild card` address in case of broadcasting.

2. **_Stream socket_**, also referenced as connection-oriented socket. Using `TCP` makes it reliable across the network.

3. **_Raw socket_** allows direct sending and receiving of IP packets without any protocol-specific `transport layer` formatting.
