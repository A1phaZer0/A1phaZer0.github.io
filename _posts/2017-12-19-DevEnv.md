Kernel development needs a stable platform which is easy to debug with and simulates from CPU to I/O.
In this article, let's talk about kernel development environment and how to setup one.

According to ![Bochs User Manual][bochs]: **"**Bochs is a program that simulates a complete Intel x86 computer. Bochs interprets every instruction from power-up to reboot, and has device models for all of the standard PC peripherals: keyboard, mouse, VGA card/monitor, disks, timer chips, network card, etc.**"**

5. `bochsrc` in the /etc directory.

Memory setup, set total memory to 512MB:
```bash
memory: guest=512, host=512 
```
ROM BIOS setup, ROM BIOS is loaded starting at `0xfffe0000`, this rom is 128KB long:
```bash
romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest, options=fastboot
```
