> **Symbol**

In gas, a symbol can be defined as:

```bash
.global var
var = 0xdeadbeef
```
**var** itself has its own value, the **linear address** of this symbol.

In gas, `$`to retrive address of varialble (lable) but it's no in all cases.

```bash
var:
    .long 0xdeadbeef
    
start:
    movl var, %eax      // Assign 0xdeabeef to EAX
    movl $var, %eax     // Assign address of var to EAX
    jmp start           // Jump to address but not using $start
    
addr:
    .long var           // Here, var gives address of var not 0xdeadbeef
```

> **asm block**

**Output List**

Gcc prevents registers in "input list" from being changed by `__asm__` codes. Hence putting registers that will be changed also in "output list" is a must.

```asm
static inline void asmcodes(int n) 
{ 
int dummy;
__asm__ __volatile__ (
    "some codes here"
    : "=a"(dummy)
    : "0"(n)
    : "memory");
}
```
Here, `dummy` for dummy output when `eax` is changed.

**Input List**

For memory access, use `"m"(\*pointer)`.

**Clobber List**

In "inline asm", clobber list contains register that are potentially changed.

`"memory"`: Force memory access order not be optimized by gcc.
`"cc"`: Tells gcc that **c**ondition **c**ontrol register (EFLAGS) migit be changed. Harmless if it's not used since in practice gcc assumes that EFLAGS always clobbered.

**Early Clobber**

Use **&** in output list to constraint a "early clobber" telling gcc that output can be written to before function finished.

> **LMA**

On some system, **p_paddr** is referenced to **LMA** not **Physical address**.
